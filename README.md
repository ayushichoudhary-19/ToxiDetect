# ToxiDetect

ToxiDetect is a tool designed to detect toxicity in text messages using TensorFlow.js and its toxicity detection model.

## Description

ToxiDetect provides a simple interface where users can input a text message, and the tool will analyze the message to determine if it contains any toxic content. The tool utilizes a pre-trained toxicity detection model from TensorFlow.js to make these assessments.

## Usage

To use ToxiDetect, follow these steps:

1. Input a text message into the provided text field.
2. Click the "Detect" button to analyze the message.
3. The tool will display the analysis results, indicating whether the message contains toxic content or not.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Real-time analysis of text messages for toxicity.
- Immediate feedback on the toxicity level of the input message.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Provides the structure and elements of the web page.
- CSS: Styles the elements to improve visual presentation and user experience.
- JavaScript: Implements the functionality of the ToxiDetect tool.
- TensorFlow.js: Utilized for loading and running the pre-trained toxicity detection model.
- TensorFlow Models (Toxicity): Pre-trained model used for detecting toxicity in text messages.

## Installation

To install ToxiDetect locally:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Purpose

I developed this project to explore TensorFlow.js and its applications in text analysis.
